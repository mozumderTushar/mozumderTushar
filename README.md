# Hi there 👋, I'm Mozumder Tushar

**Data Scientist | Full-Stack Developer | Problem Solver**  

I am a Master of Data Science graduate (GPA 6.25/7) from the University of Canberra with a foundation in Computer Science & Engineering. I bridge the gap between building robust web applications and extracting actionable insights from the data they generate. My work ranges from developing full-stack MERN applications to benchmarking complex machine learning models across different programming languages.

### 🛠 Technical Toolkit:
- **Data Science:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), R, SQL, Power BI.
- **Web Development:** JavaScript (ES6+), React.js, Node.js, Express, MongoDB
- **Performance & Research:** Rust, Statistical Analysis, and Cross-Platform Model Benchmarking
- **Analytics:** Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate (Coursera).

### 📈 Featured Research & Projects
- **ML Benchmarking:** Led a team to build a high-performance benchmarking suite using R and Rust, improving data pipeline evaluation by 35%.
- **Cybersecurity Research:** Experimental analysis and risk mitigation frameworks for Smart-Home IoT ecosystems.
- **Full-Stack Apps:** Developed various MERN-stack platforms including a Mental Health story-sharing site (MenTex) and a Doctors Portal.

### Programming Languages
- **Proficient:** JavaScript, Python, SQL, R
- **Familiar:** C++, Julia, Rust
